As per the initial vision, there will be separate pages for both English and Spanish annotations/transcriptions. This will allow for a wider variety of interaction and opportunity for engagement with the recordings, which have historically been less accessible for primarily English-speaking students and scholars. This page is an example of the Spanish transcription of the recording that is noted as being on May 20th, 1981.
